**Bounce Rate** : Rate at which the user leave the site without interaction.
**Conversion Rate** : Rate at which the user complete a goal on the site, such as sign up, purchase, etc.

The analysis indicates that conversion behaviour is likely influenced by other factors not included in the model, such as, website designing, user intent, pricing, and better sources that bring engaged users.
